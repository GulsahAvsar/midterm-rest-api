# REST API



## Requirements

* Node.js
* npm
  


## Setup Instructions 

1. Setup Node.js:

    After creating a folder called "midterm-rest-api" in VS code initialize node.js

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
2. Create *.gitignore* file

3. Install dependencies:

    Since the service depends on several npm packages install following dependencies

    *index.js*:

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
    
4. Create *index.js* file for the code (Code is generated by Chatgpt, but modified after generated)

5. Run the service:

    After installing all dependencies start the service

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    The service will be running on http://localhost:3000.
